I once watched a TED Talk called [Try Something New for Thirty Days](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days?language=en). Well, without even trying, it looks like I've done it. Every day for the past 32 days, I've pushed something to [my GitHub](http://github.com/sophstad). What started as a way for me to work consistently on [Squadfinder](http://squadfinder.3005hacks.com) has evolved into a push to learn something new every day. Now, whether I'm working on a side project, pushing to this website, or just learning more about GitHub's tools, I'm making a conscious effort to expand my knowledge. And even though the thirty days have passed, there's no end in sight for this streak.
