title: Asimov’s Creativity
---
The MIT Technology Review recently published a [previously undiscovered Isaac Asimov essay](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/531911/isaac-asimov-mulls-how-do-people-get-new-ideas/). It’s a great, simple piece that you should take a look at if you haven’t already.

One of Asimov’s most interesting points is the idea that creativity is simply a series of links—that a creative’s job is to connect the threads between two ideas and form something that is greater than the sum of its parts. He explains the idea as such:

>Obviously, then, what is needed is not only people with a good background in a particular field, but also people capable of making a connection between item 1 and item 2 which might not ordinarily seem connected.
>
>Undoubtedly in the first half of the 19th century, a great many naturalists had studied the manner in which species were differentiated among themselves. A great many people had read Malthus. Perhaps some both studied species and read Malthus. But what you needed was someone who studied species, read Malthus, and had the ability to make a cross-connection.

Steve Jobs, many years later, touched on this idea of connections. It’s almost eerie how close the ideas from [a Wired interview he did back in February 1996](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html) are to those of Asimov:

>Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they've had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.

Jobs was no thief, though—Asimov’s essay was recently discovered, untouched, in some old files, so there’s been no cross-pollination of ideas. The fact that two of the century’s most revolutionary minds were having the same thoughts never ceases to thrill me.

I was also reminded of the philosophies of Pixar’s Braintrust. (The whole story appears in *Creativity, Inc.*, but you can read a bit about the Braintrust [here](http://www.fastcompany.com/3027135/lessons-learned/inside-the-pixar-braintrust)). In short, the Braintrust is a roundtable meeting of trusted Pixar wizards that’s designed to maximize candidness, effectiveness, and success. Some hallmarks of the Braintrust include “people with a deep understanding of storytelling, who usually have been through the process themselves” and a distinct lack of power—that is, every idea offered is simply a suggestion. Pixar executives maintain that this method is the key to Pixar’s unparalleled success.

In describing his idea of a Braintrust, Asimov offers similar ideas that focus on fostering creativity:

>But how to persuade creative people to do so? First and foremost, there must be ease, relaxation, and a general sense of permissiveness. The world in general disapproves of creativity, and to be creative in public is particularly bad. Even to speculate in public is rather worrisome. The individuals must, therefore, have the feeling that the others won’t object.
