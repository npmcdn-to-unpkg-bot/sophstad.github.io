A few principles I like to follow when I’m writing:

- Sans serif for getting ideas down
- Monospaced for drafts and anything remotely technical
- Caslon for when I want to sound like I’m writing for *The New Yorker*

The link between typeface and voice is profound for readers, but it applies to writers, too. Using the right typeface can make an essay flow—it’s too bad everything academic has to be submitted in the same old Times New Roman.
