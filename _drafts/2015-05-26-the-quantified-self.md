# The Quantified Self

Technology seems to be heading in a direction that increasingly favors collecting personal data. We have Apple’s suite of health services, namely [Health](https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/health/) and the Watch’s seamless data collection. There’s the [Jawbone UP](https://jawbone.com/up), a piece of techwear that’s become seriously ubiquitous. And we’re also seeing a surge of subtle data, like Facebook’s [On This Day](http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/03/introducing-on-this-day-a-new-way-to-look-back-at-photos-and-memories-on-facebook/), a gentle reminder that the service remembers things better than any human being could ever hope to.

Riding the surge of this data popularization, I decided several weeks ago to start consciously collecting my own data—to quantify myself, for lack of a warmer term.

My iPhone has given me a wealth of tools to choose from. I have a few weapons of choice. [Last.fm](http://last.fm) is undeniably the first program that got me interested in personal data, and I still use it faithfully to record my listening habits on every device. [Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com) is a smart, beautiful app that prompts me several times a day to answer a series of questions I’ve selected. It allows me to collect only what I want to know, and implements smart integrations that make the whole experience rather seamless. [Sleep Cycle](http://www.sleepcycle.com) is the newest addition, but so far it’s proven impressive in its ability to quantify my sleep. All of these apps have quietly found their places in my daily life, and they’ve made measuring my life both simple and enjoyable. There are several trends I’ve noticed when it comes to my own data collection.

### Consistency yields objectivity
### Data makes you aware
### Failure is inevitable
